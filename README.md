system65emu: An emulator for the System65 6502-based computer system

This is system65emu, an emulator for a fictional computer system based on the
6502 CPU.

To build system65emu, you will need SFML. You will then need to link against:

 * sfml-graphics
 * sfml-window
 * sfml-system

in that order (if using gcc).
